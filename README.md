# CS314
Data Structures

This repository contains my assignments for CS 314 taught by Professor Mike Scott at UT Austin.
Many files were not created by me and were provided for the purposes of an assignment in CS 314.
I was given skeletal implementations of some source code and was expected to read, understand, and use the given code to create a working application.
The majority of the code created by me should have a comment at the top of the source code containing my information while taking the class.
 
I was also expected to create unit tests on many of the assignments to test corner cases and determine the Big O time complexity. For these, tests a Stopwatch.java was provided to test the time (this is located in the 'Other' directory). On another note, in the same directory is IOChecker.java and I cannot remember where it was used.

Some assignments were also pair assignments where students have the option to work with a partner on the conditiion that work is not partitioned. One person would code while the other watches and asks question on other ways to write the code, then the two would switch whenever they felt comfortable.



I do not support cheating, so anyone currently taking the class should NOT look through this repository.
